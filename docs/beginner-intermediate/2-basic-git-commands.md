## Basic Git Commands üñ•Ô∏èüñ•Ô∏èüñ•Ô∏è

>   In this module, we will learn about most used Git commands to get us basic knowledge to make our first contribution to source code.

### The Commands üñ•Ô∏è

1.  ```git help``` 
    This command list every possible commands that can be done along with different options that are availabe on Git.
    ```bash
        git help

7.  ```git add```
    This command adds file contents to the index(staging). This is the temporary addition of the contents into the staging environment.This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.
    a. Add everything in the directory
    ```bash
        git add .
    ```

    b. Add a single or multiple individual files
    ```bash

    ```

    c.  To add all 
    ```bash
        git add -A
    ```

8.  ```git commit```
     This record changes permanently to the repository.
     ```bash
        git commit -m <message>
    ```

9.  ```git log```
    This is show commit logs. List commits that are reachable by following the parent links from the given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s) given with a ^ in front of them. The output is given in reverse chronological order by default.

11. ```git remote```
    This manage set of tracked repositories. Manage the set of repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track. With no arguments, shows a list of existing remotes. Several subcommands are available to perform operations on the remotes.
    ```bash
        git remote
    ```
    
> Important Options: |-
    ``git remote add`` [-t <branch>] [-m <master>] [-f] [--[no-]tags] [--mirror=(fetch|push)] <name> <url> |-
    ``git remote rename`` <old> <new> |-
    ``git remote remove`` <name>

12. ```git  clone```
    This clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository (visible using git branch --remotes), and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository‚Äôs currently active branch.
    ```bash
        git clone
    ```

13. ```git branch```
    This is to list, create, or delete branches

    ```

14. ```git checkout```

    ```bash
        git checkout
    ```
> Pro tips: the branch as option

15. ```git merge```
    This is used to  join two or more development histories/branches together. Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the current branch) into the current branch. This command is used by git pull to incorporate changes from another repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch into another.
    ```bash
